Web application code for a custom powerstip. Each outlet on the powerstrip can be turned on and off individually. This web app controls turning the outlets on and off, tracks time each device is used, allows for labeling of devices plugged into each outlet, and graphs usage over time. This code runs on a Raspberry Pi with MySQL, PHP, and Apache installed. Uses the pChart library for graphing the energy usage and displaying on website.
